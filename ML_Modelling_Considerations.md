## 8. Deployment & Monitoring

### 8.1 Model Deployment Strategies

#### Web Servers / APIs

- **How it works**: The model is deployed on a traditional web server (e.g., Flask, Django for Python) and exposed via an API.
- **Key points**:
  - Suitable for models with consistent, moderate traffic
  - Allows fine-grained control over the server environment
  - Requires manual scaling and maintenance
  - Examples: REST API using Flask, FastAPI

#### Serverless

- **How it works**: The model is deployed as a function that runs on-demand in a cloud provider's serverless infrastructure.
- **Key points**:
  - Ideal for sporadic or unpredictable traffic patterns
  - Automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing
  - Cold start latency can be an issue for some use cases
  - Limited execution time and memory
  - Examples: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions

#### Container Orchestration

- **How it works**: The model is packaged in a container (e.g., Docker) and deployed on a container orchestration platform.
- **Key points**:
  - Suitable for complex models or those requiring specific environments
  - Provides portability and consistency across different environments
  - Allows for easy scaling and management of multiple model versions
  - Requires more setup and management compared to serverless
  - Examples: Kubernetes, Amazon ECS, Azure Kubernetes Service

### 8.2 Deployment Process

- Model packaging (serialization)
- Environment configuration
- Deployment script creation
- Testing in staging environment
- Gradual rollout (e.g., canary deployment)

### 8.3 Monitoring and Logging

- Set up monitoring for model performance
- Implement logging for predictions and errors
- Create dashboards for key metrics
- Set up alerts for anomalies or performance degradation

### 8.4 Scaling and Load Balancing

- Implement auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
- Set up load balancing for high-availability

### 8.5 Security Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits and updates

### 8.6 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Automate the deployment process
- Implement version control for models and code
- Set up automated testing before deployment

### 8.7 A/B Testing Framework

- Implement infrastructure for comparing model versions
- Set up metrics collection for performance comparison

### 8.8 Model Versioning and Rollback
